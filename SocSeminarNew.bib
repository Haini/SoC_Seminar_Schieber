Such systems require FPGAs with selfdetection and self-repairing capabilities in order to cope with errors due to the harsh conditions that usually exist in such environments. In this paper, a new dynamic fault recovery technique is proposed using the runtime partial reconfiguration (PR) property in FPGAs. It focuses on open interconnect faults and relies on specifying a Partially Reconfigurable block in the FPGA that is only used during the recovery process after the failure of the first module in the system. The technique uses only one location to recover from errors in any of the FPGA’s modules. Accordingly, it requires less area overhead when compared to other techniques.},

This paper addresses this issue in the context of temporary failures occurring in harsh industrial environments. The FaultTolerant design of sensors and controllers is investigated for both the In-Loop and Sensor-to-Actuator architectures. Processing is implemented on FPGAs whenever possible. Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) is used to implement sensors for fast varying applications while Temporal Redundancy (TR) is used for sensors for slow varying applications in order to reduce cost without affecting system reliability. Dynamic Partial Reconfiguration (DPR) is used for fault recovery. Reliability models are developed for all Fault-Tolerant blocks to help system designers with the choice of the Fault-Tolerant techniques to be implemented. Two case studies are carried out with different numbers of fast and slow sensors. System reliabilities are calculated for both conventional and hybrid NCS systems. Results show that the proposed technique results in a costeffective system at the expense of a very slight decrease in reliability.},

  abstract = {While allowing for the fabrication of increasingly complex and efficient circuitry, transistor shrinkage and count-per-device expansion have major downsides: chiefly increased variation, degradation and fault susceptibility. For this reason, design-time consideration of fault tolerance will have to be given to increasing numbers of electronic systems in the future to ensure yields, reliabilities and lifetimes remain acceptably high. Many commonly implemented operators are suited to modification resulting in datapath error detection capabilities with low area overheads. FPGAs are uniquely placed to allow further area savings to be made when incorporating fault avoidance mechanisms thanks to their dynamic reconfigurability. In this paper, we examine the practicalities and costs involved in implementing hardware-software fault tolerance on a test platform: a parallel matrix multiplication accelerator in hardware, with controller in software, running on a Xilinx Zynq system-on-chip. A combination of `bolt-on' error detection logic and software-triggered routing reconfiguration serve to provide low-overhead datapath fault tolerance at runtime. Rapid yet accurate fault diagnoses along with low hardware (area), software (configuration storage) and performance penalties are achieved.},

  abstract = {Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are rapidly gaining popularity as implementation platforms for complex space-borne computing systems. However, such systems are exposed to cosmic radiation with levels orders of magnitude higher than terrestrial levels which can cause transient and even permanent hardware faults in on-board computing platforms. Because of this, development of effective fault mitigation methods and self-repair mechanisms has become a vital aspect for FPGA-based space-borne computing platforms. This work presents a novel method for transient and permanent fault mitigation and run-time fault recovery for commercial-grade FPGA devices with partially reconfigurable tile-based architectures. The proposed method ensures the same pre-determined recovery time for transient and permanent hardware faults through dynamic on-chip component relocation regardless of the fault type. The method makes use of fully distributed control, communication, self-synchronization and self-integration mechanisms embedded in each on-chip hardware component. Run-time collaboration between components provides relocation \& fault mitigation procedures. The distributed nature of the above mechanisms excludes most central failure points which could cause non-restorable system faults. This method has been implemented, tested and verified on a Xilinx Kintex-7 FPGA platform. Results show that the proposed method is significantly more resource efficient when compared with Triple-Module Redundancy or central, software-based control mechanisms.},

Its applicability has been explored in various application domains such as automotive, consumer electronics, industrial control, medical equipment, and so forth. The topic owes its attractiveness to many examples in insects, animals and humans, where self-awareness is attributed to facilitate highly resilient and outstandingly efficient behaviors. Thus, self-awareness holds the promise to promote dependability in all types of smart gadgets and artificial agents in the interconnected world of future.This tutorial will introduce the concepts surrounding self-awareness in the context of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). A key facet of CPS is the inherent control function where the environment is sensed, the system is analyzed, and adaptions are applied to respect constraints and achieve desired goals. In control theory the design and analysis of autonomous systems has long been subject of intensive research. In recent years self-awareness has been proposed as a handle to equip traditional control systems with a deeper understanding about itself and its environment in the context of the goals of the system. The design community of complex hardware integrated circuits, embedded and cyber-physical systems has also recognized self-awareness as a means to improve dependable behavior in the presence of uncertainties, faulty components and unexpected changes of the environment.},

  abstract = {Conventionally, the design of fault-tolerant architectures for space applications has mainly been focused on reliability and correction latency. However, based on cost reduction requirements, the power consumption must also be minimized, as it impacts the battery size and the weight of the satellite. While technology scaling helps in this purpose, it also increases the circuit sensitivity to Multiple-Bit Upsets (MBU), thus specific design techniques must be applied to compensate this effect. In order to leverage high-performance and low-cost Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) FPGAs in space applications, this work tackles fault tolerance along three abstraction levels: circuit, organization and control. At the circuit level, a new ultra-low overhead Forward Temporal Redundancy (FTR) scheme is proposed for error detection in user logic. At the organization level in the FPGA, this work leverages the opportunities brought by frame- and module-based Dynamic Partial Reconfiguration (DPR) to handle configuration memory errors. At the control level, this work fully exploits the modern Xilinx Zynq System-on-Chip FPGA which embeds a hard processor used for circuit state preservation with checkpointing and rollback. The overall topology is successfully validated with 99.998\% reliability through fault-injection for a five-stage pipelined MIPS processor at a global resource overhead of only 85\% in LUTs and 125\% in flip-flops.},

  abstract = {Miniaturized satellites are currently not considered suitable for critical, high-priority, and complex multi-phased missions, due to their low reliability. As hardware-side fault tolerance (FT) solutions designed for larger spacecraft can not be adopted aboard very small satellites due to budget, energy, and size constraints, we developed a hybrid FT-approach based upon only COTS components, commodity processor cores, library IP, and standard software. This approach facilitates fault detection, isolation, and recovery in software, and utilizes fault-coverage techniques across the embedded stack within an multiprocessor system-on-chip (MPSoC). This allows our FPGA-based proofof-concept implementation to deliver strong fault-coverage even for missions with a long duration, but also to adapt to varying performance requirements during the mission. The operator of a spacecraft utilizing this approach can define performance profiles, which allow an on-board computer (OBC) to trade between processing capacity, fault coverage, and energy consumption using simple heuristics. The software-side FT approach developed also offers advantages if deployed aboard larger spacecraft through spare resource pooling, enabling an OBC to more efficiently handle permanent faults. This FT approach in part mimics a critical biological systems’s way of tolerating and adjusting to failures, enabling graceful ageing of an MPSoC.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a self-adaptive FPGA-based, partially reconfigurable system for space missions in order to mitigate Single Event Upsets in the FPGA configuration and fabric. Dynamic reconfiguration is used here for an on-demand replication of modules in dependence of current and changing radiation levels. More precisely, the idea is to trigger a redundancy scheme such as Dual Modular Redundancy or Triple Modular Redundancy in response to a continuously monitored Single Event Upset rate measured inside the on-chip memories itself, e.g., any subset (even used) internal Block RAMs. Depending on the current radiation level, the minimal number of replicas is determined at runtime under the constraint that a required Safety Integrity Level for a module is ensured and configured accordingly. For signal processing applications it is shown that this autonomous adaption to the different solar conditions realizes a resource efficient mitigation. In our case study, we show that it is possible to triplicate the data throughput at the Solar Maximum condition (no flares) compared to a Triple Modular Redundancy implementation of a single module. We also show the decreasing Probability of Failures Per Hour by 2 × 104at flare-enhanced conditions compared with a non-redundant system.},

To solve this problem, Virtual Coarse Grained Reconfigurable Arrays (Virtual CGRA), or CGRAs implemented on FPGAs, have been proposed. Conventional implementations of VCGRAs use functional FPGA resources, such as LookUp Tables, to implement the virtual switch blocks, registers and other components that make the VCGRA configurable. We show that this is a large overhead that can often be avoided by mapping these components directly on lower level FPGA resources such as physical switch blocks and configuration memory. We show how this can be achieved using the tool flow for parameterised FPGA configurations and illustrate the advantages of this method by showing that an area reduction of 50\% is attainable for a VCGRA aimed at regular expression matching.},

  abstract = {Recently, existing radiation-hardened static random access memory (SRAM)-based field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are anticipated for use in space radiation environments. Although such radiation-hardened SRAM-based FPGAs are programmable, the use of a radiation-damaged gate array has never been assessed for use with application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) because its serial configuration is invariably damaged first by radiation so that the configuration itself becomes impossible. Therefore, currently available FPGA cannot be used in such faulty gate arrays used in space environments. However, if faulty programmable gate arrays are used, then the total ionizing dose tolerance of the programmable gate array would be increased even if its process technology were the same as that of conventional FPGAs. In this paper, in order to explore the possibility, we experimentally assessed the configuration circuit robust capabilities of a normal Cyclone II FPGA. Also, we examined the failure probability when using 1-bit, 2-bit, 4-bit, and 8-bit buses for the FPGA configuration using the designs of serially configured FPGAs.},

Thus, the need for fault tolerance and reliability of deployed systems becomes increasingly prominent. This paper discusses fault tolerance and reliability observed in the design of a parallel self-healing VLSI system, based on partial dynamic reconfiguration (PDR) and built-in-self-test (BIST) for delay/stuck-at faults. PDR is employed to keep the system on line while under repair, for reduced power consumption and also to reduce repair time. Results prove that, a self-healing FFT prototype system implemented on Virtex6 FPGA can tolerate stressful sequences of injected delay and permanent faults with nominal impact on the system performance (hardware overhead and delay). The review of research proves that the proposed system is ideal for VLSI implementations of low power application fault tolerant systems.},

Monitoring and debugging is a real challenge due to the NoC system complexity and large scale size. A key requirement is an evaluation and benchmarking mechanism to quantitatively analyse a NoC system's fault tolerant capability. A novel monitoring mechanism is proposed to evaluate the fault tolerant capability of an NoC by: (1) using a compact monitor probe to detect the events of each NoC node, (2) re-using the exist NoC infrastructure to communicate analysis data of back to a terminal PC which removes the need for additional hardware resources and maintain hardware scalability and (3) calculating throughput, the number of lost/corrupted packets and generating a heat map of NoC traffic for quantitative analysis. The paper presents results on a case study using an example fault-tolerant routing algorithm and highlights the minimal area overhead of the monitoring mechanism ( 6\%). Results demonstrate that the proposed online monitoring strategy is highly scalable due to the compact monitor probe and the ability to reuse the existing NoC communication infrastructure. In addition, the traffic heat map generation and throughput display demonstrates benefits in aiding NoC system prototyping and debugging.},

  abstract = {Dynamic Partial Reconfiguration (DPR) has been used as a solution to deal with permanent faults in space-borne based on off-the-shelf Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) devices when they are exposed to the radiation environment. Mechanisms based on DPR must detect the permanent fault in a module and perform the reconfiguration process. A major issue is the amount of silicon resources reserved for that, as the design methodology employed so far requires different partial implementations for the same module. This work proposes a design flow and describes a mechanism to deal with permanent faults, in which the amount of Reconfigurable Partitions (RPs) is reduced, resulting in a better usage of silicon resources available in an FPGA.},

Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) is a well known approach for a system to tolerate possible faults, but a permanent fault in the TMR hardware may diminish the redundancy advantage. In this paper, we present a low cost solution to improve some dependability figures of a TMR system. The methodology comprises a design flow, which is used in the implementation of the proposed Partial Bit stream for Multiple Partitions (PB4MP) mechanism. The strategy allows modules's relocation in different Reconfigurable Partitions (RPs) using only one bit stream per module, enabling fault prevention and fault removal (recovery) actions. The results show that with a minor increase in the digital design configuration memory, it is possible to improve considerably the TMR availability, reliability and maintainability.},

  abstract = {Traditional embedded systems are evolving into power-and-performance-domain self-aware intelligent systems in order to overcome complexity and uncertainty. Without human control, they need to keep operative states in applications such as drone-based delivery or robotic space landing. Nowadays, the partial and run-time reconfiguration (RTR) of FPGA-based Systems-on-chip (SoC) can enable dynamic hardware acceleration or self-healing structures, but this conversely increases system-memory traffic. This paper introduces the basis of cognitive reconfigurable hardware and presents the design of an FPGA-based RTR SoC that becomes conscious of its monitored hardware and learns to make decisions that maintain a desired system performance, particularly when triggering hardware acceleration and dynamic fault-tolerant (FT) schemes on RTR cores. Self-awareness is achieved by evaluating monitored metrics in critical AXI-cores, supported by hardware performance counters. We suggest a reinforcement-learning algorithm that helps the system to search out when and which reconfigurable FT-scheme can be triggered. Executing random sequences of an embedded benchmark suite simulates unpredictability and bus traffic. The evaluation shows the effectiveness and implications of our approach.},

  abstract = {This paper explores advances in reconfiguration properties of SRAM-based FPGAs, namely Partial Dynamic Reconfiguration, to improve the resilience of critical systems that take advantage of this technology. Commercial of-the-shelf state-of-the-art FPGA devices use SRAM cells for the configuration memory, which allow an increase in both performance and capacity. The fast access times and unlimited number of writes of this technology, reduces reconfiguration delays and extends the device lifetime but, at the same time, makes them more sensitive to radiation effects, in the form of Single Event Upsets. To overcome this limitation, manufacturers have proposed a few fault tolerant approaches, which rely on space/time redundancy and configuration memory content recovery - scrubbing. In this paper, we first present radiation effects on these devices and investigate the applicability of the most commonly used fault tolerant approaches, and then propose an approach to improve FPGA resilience, through the use of a less intrusive failure prediction scrubbing. It is expected that this approach relieves the system designer from dependability concerns and reduces both time intrusiveness and overall power consumption.},

Charged particles cause the so-called Single Event Upsets (SEUs) in their configuration memory. SEUs can induce failure of the whole system. This problem is fundamental for space applications where sun radiation is more considerable than in the Earth. Two main approaches to SEU mitigation technique exist: fault masking and repair. The most popular masking method is Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR). For the faults repair, FPGA's capability of reconfiguration is used. It is possible to combine these approaches to obtain improved fault tolerant system. It is important to assess reliability rate of this system and, therefore, its estimation by a simulation is the main part of this paper. We propose evaluation environment which assesses the reliability of a TMR system with malfunction module reconfiguration depending on faults occurrence frequency and reconfiguration time necessary for fault repair.},

  abstract = {To avoid packet loss and deadlock scenarios that arise due to faults or power gating in multicore and many-core systems, the network-on-chip needs to possess resilient communication and load-balancing properties. In this work, we introduce the Fashion router, a self-monitoring and self-reconfiguring design that allows for the on-chip network to dynamically adapt to component failures. First, we introduce a distributed intelligence unit, called Self-Awareness Module (SAM), which allows the router to detect permanent component failures and build a network connectivity map. Using local information, SAM adapts to faults, guarantees connectivity and deadlock-free routing inside the maximal connected subgraph and keeps routing tables up-to-date. Next, to reconfigure network links or virtual channels around faulty/power-gated components, we add bidirectional link and unified virtual channel structure features to the Fashion router. This version of the router, named Ex-Fashion, further mitigates the negative system performance impacts, leads to larger maximal connected subgraph and sustains a relatively high degree of fault-tolerance. To support the router, we develop a fault diagnosis and recovery algorithm executed by the Built-In Self-Test, self-monitoring, and self-reconfiguration units at runtime to provide fault-tolerant system functionalities. The Fashion router places no restriction on topology, position or number of faults. It drops 54.3-55.4\% fewer nodes for same number of faults (between 30 and 60 faults) in an 8x8 2D-mesh over other state-of-the-art solutions. It is scalable and efficient. The area overheads are 2.311\% and 2.659\% when implemented in 8x8 and 16x16 2D-meshes using the TSMC 65nm library at 1.38GHz clock frequency.},

In fact, the capability of reconfiguring the system during run-time execution and the high computational power of modern Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) make these devices suitable for intensive data processing tasks. Moreover, such systems must also guarantee the abilities of self-awareness, self-diagnosis and self-repair in order to cope with errors due to the harsh conditions typically existing in some environments. In this paperwe propose a self-repairing method for partially and dynamically reconfigurable systems applied at a fine-grain granularity level. Our method is able to detect correct and recover errors using the run-time capabilities offered by modern SRAM-based FPGAs. Fault injection campaigns have been executed on a dynamically reconfigurable system embedding a number of benchmark circuits. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves full detection of single and multiple errors, while significantly improving the system availability with respect to traditional error detection and correction methods.},

  abstract = {Cyber-Physical Systems are experiencing a paradigm shift in which processing has been relocated to the distributed sensing layer and is no longer performed in a centralized manner. This approach, usually referred to as Edge Computing, demands the use of hardware platforms that are able to manage the steadily increasing requirements in computing performance, while keeping energy efficiency and the adaptability imposed by the interaction with the physical world. In this context, SRAM-based FPGAs and their inherent run-time reconfigurability, when coupled with smart power management strategies, are a suitable solution. However, they usually fail in user accessibility and ease of development. In this paper, an integrated framework to develop FPGA-based high-performance embedded systems for Edge Computing in Cyber-Physical Systems is presented. This framework provides a hardware-based processing architecture, an automated toolchain, and a runtime to transparently generate and manage reconfigurable systems from high-level system descriptions without additional user intervention. Moreover, it provides users with support for dynamically adapting the available computing resources to switch the working point of the architecture in a solution space defined by computing performance, energy consumption and fault tolerance. Results show that it is indeed possible to explore this solution space at run time and prove that the proposed framework is a competitive alternative to software-based edge computing platforms, being able to provide not only faster solutions, but also higher energy efficiency for computing-intensive algorithms with significant levels of data-level parallelism.},

We present a holistic approach that enables self-awareness across the software/hardware stack, from systems-on-chip to systems-of-systems (autonomous car) contexts. We use the Information Processing Factory (IPF) metaphor as an exemplar to show how self-awareness can be achieved across multiple abstraction levels, and discuss new research challenges. The IPF approach represents a paradigm shift in platform design by envisioning the move towards a consequent platform-centric design in which the combination of self-organizing learning and formal reactive methods guarantee the applicability of such cyber-physical systems in safety-critical and high-availability applications.},

However, self-awareness mechanisms of all layers must be considered in combination in order to build a coherent vehicle self-awareness that does not cause conflicting decisions or even catastrophic effects. In this paper, we summarize current approaches for establishing self-awareness on those layers and elaborate why self-awareness needs to be addressed as a cross-layer problem, which we illustrate by practical examples.},

  abstract = {Systems for application domains like robotics, aerospace, defense, autonomous vehicles, etc. are usually developed on System-on-Programmable Chip (SoPC) platforms, capable of supporting several multi-modal computation-intensive tasks on their FPGAs. Since such systems are mostly autonomous and mobile, they have rechargeable power sources and therefore, varying power budgets. They may also develop hardware faults due to radiation, thermal cycling, aging, etc. Systems must be able to sustain the performance requirements of their multi-task multi-modal workload in the presence of variations in available power or occurrence of hardware faults. This paper presents an approach for mitigating power budget variations and hardware faults (transient and permanent) by run-time structural adaptation of the SoPC. The proposed method is based on dynamically allocating, relocating and re-integrating task-specific processing circuits inside the partially reconfigurable FPGA to accommodate the available power budget, satisfy tasks’ performances and hardware resource constraints, and/or to restore task functionality affected by hardware faults. The proposed method has been experimentally implemented on the ARM Cortex-A9 processor of Xilinx Zynq XC7Z020 FPGA. Results have shown that structural adaptation can be done in units of milliseconds since the worst-case decision-making process does not exceed the reconfiguration time of a partial bit-stream.},

As modern vehicles incorporate more complex computational systems, ensuring the safety of critical systems becomes paramount. One-to-one redundant units have been previously proposed as measures for evolving critical functions like x-by-wire. However, these may not be viable solutions for power-constrained systems like next generation electric vehicles. Reconfigurable architectures offer alternative approaches to implementing reliable safety critical systems using more efficient hardware. In this paper, we present an approach for implementing redundancy in safety-critical in-car systems, that uses FPGA partial reconfiguration and a customised bus controller to offer fast recovery from faults.

However, modern generations of MP-SoCs have an increasing sensitivity to faults due to the progressive shrinking technology. Consequently, in order to evaluate the fault sensitivity in NoC architectures, there is the need of accurate test solution which allows to evaluate the fault tolerance capability of NoCs. This paper presents an innovative test architecture based on a dual-processor system which is able to extensively test mesh based NoCs. The proposed solution improves previously developed methods since it is based on a NoC physical implementation which allows to investigate the effects induced by several kind of faults thanks to the execution of on-line fault injection within all the network interface and router resources during NoC run-time operations. The solution has been physically implemented on an FPGA platform using a NoC emulation model adopting standard communication protocols. The obtained results demonstrated the effectiveness of the developed solution in term of testability and diagnostic capabilities and make our solutions suitable for testing large scale NoC design.},

In this context, Dynamic Partial Reconfiguration (DPR) enables a more optimized and reliable usage of state-of-the-art Xilinx SRAM-based Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) resources over space and time. DPR techniques make use of the Internal Configuration Access Port (ICAP), an internal FPGA interface that allows changing on the fly the functionality of a portion of its logic. Unfortunately, a standard DPR flow requires the use of at least a microprocessor (MicroBlaze, PowerPC or ARM), extra memories due to the microprocessor and several peripherals, which results in dense and complex designs that may be easily corrupted by radiation incidence. This chapter presents a generic DPR manager core that has been optimized to provide high reliability. Results are shown in terms of performance, resources utilization and fault tolerance capability, which reinforce its advantages over traditional solutions.},

The study of reconfigurable heterogeneous systems is still maturing and, while some contributions about performance and power consumption are available, in literature there are few works addressing reliability. This paper analyzes reconfigurable heterogeneous systems in presence of permanent faults occurring in the FPGA. In this context, a reconfigurable heterogeneous architecture, including a Run Time Manager responsible for the communication of software tasks and the FPGA, the scheduling and the placement of hardware tasks, is presented. In addition, the paper introduces a reconfigurable heterogeneous system simulator for the proposed architecture.

Although highly flexible and generally less expensive than predominantly used ASICs, SRAM-based FPGAs are very susceptible to radiation effects. Hence, various fault tolerant techniques have to be applied in order to handle faults and protect the design. This paper presents a reconfigurable on-board processor capable of run-time adaptation to harsh environmental conditions and different functional demands. Run-time reconfigurability is achieved applying two different reconfiguration methodologies. We propose a novel self-reconfigurable architecture able to on demand duplicate or triplicate part of the design in order to form DMR and TMR structures. Moreover, we introduce two different approaches for voting the correct output. The first one is a traditional voter that adapts to different DMR/TMR domain positions whereas the second implies comparing the captured flip-flop values directly from the configuration memory read through ICAP. The comparison is done periodically by an embedded processor thus completely excluding the voting mechanism in hardware. The proposed run-time reconfiguration methodology provides savings in terms of device utilization, reconfiguration time, power consumption and significant reductions in the amount of rad-hard memory used by partial configurations.},

  abstract = {Currently most FPGAs use SRAM-based technology, which are susceptible to faults from external electromagnetic radiation or produced by long-time internal overload operation. The dynamic partial reconfigurable (DPR) system, as an emerging technology, provides a promising way to solve this problem by reallocating the tasks in damaged resource areas to non-faulty regions at runtime. Based on such idea, an infrastructure for coordinately executing specialized hardware tasks on a reconfigurable FPGA is presented to achieve the flexibility for tolerating the occurring faults at runtime. Moreover, a method named MER-3D-Contact that combines the maximum empty rectangles (MER) technique with the adjacency heuristic is proposed to allocate tasks in the dynamical partial reconfiguration system for higher resource utilization, higher task acceptance ratio and lower fragmentation ratio. At last, experiments are carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed system, results show that the proposed system can make the highest improvement 36\% without damaged areas and the highest improvement 58\% with damaged resources in terms of task acceptance ratio. Thus, the proposed system is expected a wide application in the field of more reliable FPGAs.},

  abstract = {The growing reliance on intellectual properties exposes systems on chip (SoCs) to many security vulnerabilities and is raising more and more concerns. At the same time, with the quick increase in chip density and deep scaling of feature size, current billion-transistor chip designs introduce more challenges to manufacturing fault-free chips. In this paper, we propose an integrated run-time solution for both security and fault tolerance of field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA)-based SoCs through digital signatures, live monitoring, adaptive routing, and partial reconfiguration supported by an in-house-developed network on chip, X-Network. Our X-Network reduces the ratio of required routers versus processing elements with better performance, and more importantly, offers more flexibility than conventional networks to facilitate fault tolerance and security designs. A multiplexed Montgomery modular multiplication architecture is used to increase the speed of the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman algorithm. The design has been implemented and tested on a Xilinx Virtex-6 FPGA development board. Experimental results show that even if up to 20\% of the links in the network are faulty, our reconfigurable architecture and algorithm manage to route packets around such faults, and deliver them to their destinations in a relatively low latency. Unlike conventional fault-tolerant methods that usually require resource redundancy, our design does not incur significant area or speed degradation. The resource overhead for both security and fault-tolerant features is around 10\% more lookup tables.},

  abstract = {The main design challenge in developing space computers featuring hybrid system-on-chip (SoC) devices is determining the optimal combination of size, weight, power, cost, performance, and reliability for the target mission, while addressing the complexity associated with combining fixed and reconfigurable logic. This paper focuses upon fault-tolerant computing with adaptive hardware redundancy in fixed and reconfigurable logic, with the goal of providing and evaluating tradeoffs in system reliability, performance, and resource utilization. Our research targets the hybrid Xilinx Zynq SoC as the primary computational device on a flight computer. Typically, flight software on a Zynq runs on the ARM cores that by default operate in symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) mode. However, radiation tests have shown this mode can leave the system prone to upsets. To address this limitation, we present a new framework (HARFT: hybrid adaptive reconfigurable fault tolerance) that enables switching between three operating modes: (1) ARM cores running together in SMP mode; (2) ARM cores running independently in asymmetric multiprocessing (AMP) mode; and (3) an FPGAenhanced mode for fault tolerance. While SMP is the default mode, AMP mode may be used for fault-tolerant and real-time extensions. Additionally, the FPGA-enhanced mode uses partially reconfigurable regions to vary the level of redundancy and include application- and environment-specific techniques for fault mitigation and application acceleration.},

The technique is oriented on further dynamic partial reconfiguration of the system. An adequate splitting algorithm of the system into the dynamic (reconfigurable) and static (non-reconfigurable) partitions is proposed. The main advantage of the presented idea is the possibility of the dynamic reconfiguration of the already implemented system. It means that the functionality of the selected component (module) of the controller can be changed, while the rest of the system is still running. The presented technique is illustrated by a real-life case-study example, and it has been verified experimentally with the application of Xilinx FPGA device.},

Even a single link failure can make an entire chip useless. Single link failure problem is fatal to application-specific Network-on-Chip (NoC) designs as well if they cannot tolerate such failures. One solution to this problem can be having alternative routing options on the network for each communicating pair. In this study, we present an FPGA implementation of such a method for application-specific NoCs. This method adds additional network resources to the non-fault-tolerant design in an attempt to make it fault-tolerant. We show the effects of the presented fault-tolerant method on an FPGA implementation of Mp3 encoder based on energy consumption and area increase against non-fault-tolerant case.},
