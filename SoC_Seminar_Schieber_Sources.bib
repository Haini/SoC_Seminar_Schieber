	abstract = {Self-awareness has been used in many research ﬁelds in order to add autonomy to computing systems. In automotive systems, we face several system layers that must be enriched with self-awareness to build truly autonomous vehicles. This includes functional aspects like autonomous driving itself, its integration on the hardware/software platform, and among others dependability, real-time, and security aspects. However, self-awareness mechanisms of all layers must be considered in combination in order to build a coherent vehicle self-awareness that does not cause conﬂicting decisions or even catastrophic effects. In this paper, we summarize current approaches for establishing self-awareness on those layers and elaborate why self-awareness needs to be addressed as a cross-layer problem, which we illustrate by practical examples.},

	abstract = {Critical applications must rely on fault-tolerant systems in order to guarantee an error-free execution since the cost of a system fault can be paid in terms of millions of dollars or, even worse, in terms of human lives. In this context, Dynamic Partial Reconfiguration ({DPR}) enables a more optimized and reliable usage of state-of-the-art Xilinx {SRAM}-based Field Programmable Gate Arrays ({FPGA}) resources over space and time. {DPR} techniques make use of the Internal Configuration Access Port ({ICAP}), an internal {FPGA} interface that allows changing on the fly the functionality of a portion of its logic. Unfortunately, a standard {DPR} flow requires the use of at least a microprocessor ({MicroBlaze}, {PowerPC} or {ARM}), extra memories due to the microprocessor and several peripherals, which results in dense and complex designs that may be easily corrupted by radiation incidence. This chapter presents a generic {DPR} manager core that has been optimized to provide high reliability. Results are shown in terms of performance, resources utilization and fault tolerance capability, which reinforce its advantages over traditional solutions.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.02313},
	shorttitle = {{FASHION}},
	abstract = {To avoid packet loss and deadlock scenarios that arise due to faults or power gating in multicore and many-core systems, the network-on-chip needs to possess resilient communication and load-balancing properties. In this work, we introduce the Fashion router, a self-monitoring and self-reconfiguring design that allows for the on-chip network to dynamically adapt to component failures. First, we introduce a distributed intelligence unit, called Self-Awareness Module ({SAM}), which allows the router to detect permanent component failures and build a network connectivity map. Using local information, {SAM} adapts to faults, guarantees connectivity and deadlock-free routing inside the maximal connected subgraph and keeps routing tables up-to-date. Next, to reconfigure network links or virtual channels around faulty/power-gated components, we add bidirectional link and unified virtual channel structure features to the Fashion router. This version of the router, named Ex-Fashion, further mitigates the negative system performance impacts, leads to larger maximal connected subgraph and sustains a relatively high degree of fault-tolerance. To support the router, we develop a fault diagnosis and recovery algorithm executed by the Built-In Self-Test, self-monitoring, and self-reconfiguration units at runtime to provide fault-tolerant system functionalities. The Fashion router places no restriction on topology, position or number of faults. It drops 54.3-55.4\% fewer nodes for same number of faults (between 30 and 60 faults) in an 8x8 2D-mesh over other state-of-the-art solutions. It is scalable and efficient. The area overheads are 2.311\% and 2.659\% when implemented in 8x8 and 16x16 2D-meshes using the {TSMC} 65nm library at 1.38GHz clock frequency.},

	abstract = {Traditional embedded systems are evolving into power-and-performance-domain self-aware intelligent systems in order to overcome complexity and uncertainty. Without human control, they need to keep operative states in applications such as drone-based delivery or robotic space landing. Nowadays, the partial and run-time reconfiguration ({RTR}) of {FPGA}-based Systems-on-chip ({SoC}) can enable dynamic hardware acceleration or self-healing structures, but this conversely increases system-memory traffic. This paper introduces the basis of cognitive reconfigurable hardware and presents the design of an {FPGA}-based {RTR} {SoC} that becomes conscious of its monitored hardware and learns to make decisions that maintain a desired system performance, particularly when triggering hardware acceleration and dynamic fault-tolerant ({FT}) schemes on {RTR} cores. Self-awareness is achieved by evaluating monitored metrics in critical {AXI}-cores, supported by hardware performance counters. We suggest a reinforcement-learning algorithm that helps the system to search out when and which reconfigurable {FT}-scheme can be triggered. Executing random sequences of an embedded benchmark suite simulates unpredictability and bus traffic. The evaluation shows the effectiveness and implications of our approach.},

Triple Modular Redundancy ({TMR}) is used to implement sensors for fast varying applications while Temporal Redundancy ({TR}) is used for sensors for slow varying applications in order to reduce cost without affecting system reliability. Dynamic Partial Reconfiguration ({DPR}) is used for fault recovery. Reliability models are developed for all Fault-Tolerant blocks to help system designers with the choice of the Fault-Tolerant techniques to be implemented. Two case studies are carried out with different numbers of fast and slow sensors. System reliabilities are calculated for both conventional and hybrid {NCS} systems. Results show that the proposed technique results in a costeffective system at the expense of a very slight decrease in reliability.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a self-adaptive {FPGA}-based, partially reconfigurable system for space missions in order to mitigate Single Event Upsets in the {FPGA} configuration and fabric. Dynamic reconfiguration is used here for an on-demand replication of modules in dependence of current and changing radiation levels. More precisely, the idea is to trigger a redundancy scheme such as Dual Modular Redundancy or Triple Modular Redundancy in response to a continuously monitored Single Event Upset rate measured inside the on-chip memories itself, e.g., any subset (even used) internal Block {RAMs}. Depending on the current radiation level, the minimal number of replicas is determined at runtime under the constraint that a required Safety Integrity Level for a module is ensured and configured accordingly. For signal processing applications it is shown that this autonomous adaption to the different solar conditions realizes a resource efficient mitigation. In our case study, we show that it is possible to triplicate the data throughput at the Solar Maximum condition (no flares) compared to a Triple Modular Redundancy implementation of a single module. We also show the decreasing Probability of Failures Per Hour by 2 × 104at flare-enhanced conditions compared with a non-redundant system.},

	abstract = {Cyber-Physical Systems are experiencing a paradigm shift in which processing has been relocated to the distributed sensing layer and is no longer performed in a centralized manner. This approach, usually referred to as Edge Computing, demands the use of hardware platforms that are able to manage the steadily increasing requirements in computing performance, while keeping energy efﬁciency and the adaptability imposed by the interaction with the physical world. In this context, {SRAM}-based {FPGAs} and their inherent run-time reconﬁgurability, when coupled with smart power management strategies, are a suitable solution. However, they usually fail in user accessibility and ease of development. In this paper, an integrated framework to develop {FPGA}-based high-performance embedded systems for Edge Computing in Cyber-Physical Systems is presented. This framework provides a hardware-based processing architecture, an automated toolchain, and a runtime to transparently generate and manage reconﬁgurable systems from high-level system descriptions without additional user intervention. Moreover, it provides users with support for dynamically adapting the available computing resources to switch the working point of the architecture in a solution space deﬁned by computing performance, energy consumption and fault tolerance. Results show that it is indeed possible to explore this solution space at run time and prove that the proposed framework is a competitive alternative to software-based edge computing platforms, being able to provide not only faster solutions, but also higher energy efﬁciency for computing-intensive algorithms with signiﬁcant levels of data-level parallelism.},

Results prove that, a self-healing {FFT} prototype system implemented on Virtex6 {FPGA} can tolerate stressful sequences of injected delay and permanent faults with nominal impact on the system performance (hardware overhead and delay). The review of research proves that the proposed system is ideal for {VLSI} implementations of low power application fault tolerant systems.},

One solution to this problem can be having alternative routing options on the network for each communicating pair. In this study, we present an {FPGA} implementation of such a method for application-specific {NoCs}. This method adds additional network resources to the non-fault-tolerant design in an attempt to make it fault-tolerant.

This paper presents an innovative test architecture based on a dual-processor system which is able to extensively test mesh based {NoCs}. The proposed solution improves previously developed methods since it is based on a {NoC} physical implementation which allows to investigate the effects induced by several kind of faults thanks to the execution of on-line fault injection within all the network interface and router resources during {NoC} run-time operations. The solution has been physically implemented on an {FPGA} platform using a {NoC} emulation model adopting standard communication protocols.

Monitoring and debugging is a real challenge due to the {NoC} system complexity and large scale size. A key requirement is an evaluation and benchmarking mechanism to quantitatively analyse a {NoC} system's fault tolerant capability. A novel monitoring mechanism is proposed to evaluate the fault tolerant capability of an {NoC} by: (1) using a compact monitor probe to detect the events of each {NoC} node, (2) re-using the exist {NoC} infrastructure to communicate analysis data of back to a terminal {PC} which removes the need for additional hardware resources and maintain hardware scalability and (3) calculating throughput, the number of lost/corrupted packets and generating a heat map of {NoC} traffic for quantitative analysis. The paper presents results on a case study using an example fault-tolerant routing algorithm and highlights the minimal area overhead of the monitoring mechanism ( 6\%). Results demonstrate that the proposed online monitoring strategy is highly scalable due to the compact monitor probe and the ability to reuse the existing {NoC} communication infrastructure. In addition, the traffic heat map generation and throughput display demonstrates benefits in aiding {NoC} system prototyping and debugging.},

Although highly flexible and generally less expensive than predominantly used {ASICs}, {SRAM}-based {FPGAs} are very susceptible to radiation effects. Hence, various fault tolerant techniques have to be applied in order to handle faults and protect the design. This paper presents a reconfigurable on-board processor capable of run-time adaptation to harsh environmental conditions and different functional demands. Run-time reconfigurability is achieved applying two different reconfiguration methodologies. We propose a novel self-reconfigurable architecture able to on demand duplicate or triplicate part of the design in order to form {DMR} and {TMR} structures. Moreover, we introduce two different approaches for voting the correct output. The first one is a traditional voter that adapts to different {DMR}/{TMR} domain positions whereas the second implies comparing the captured flip-flop values directly from the configuration memory read through {ICAP}. The comparison is done periodically by an embedded processor thus completely excluding the voting mechanism in hardware. The proposed run-time reconfiguration methodology provides savings in terms of device utilization, reconfiguration time, power consumption and significant reductions in the amount of rad-hard memory used by partial configurations.},

Since such systems are mostly autonomous and mobile, they have rechargeable power sources and therefore, varying power budgets. They may also develop hardware faults due to radiation, thermal cycling, aging, etc. Systems must be able to sustain the performance requirements of their multi-task multi-modal workload in the presence of variations in available power or occurrence of hardware faults. This paper presents an approach for mitigating power budget variations and hardware faults (transient and permanent) by run-time structural adaptation of the {SoPC}. The proposed method is based on dynamically allocating, relocating and re-integrating task-speciﬁc processing circuits inside the partially reconﬁgurable {FPGA} to accommodate the available power budget, satisfy tasks’ performances and hardware resource constraints, and/or to restore task functionality affected by hardware faults. The proposed method has been experimentally implemented on the {ARM} Cortex-A9 processor of Xilinx Zynq {XC}7Z020 {FPGA}. Results have shown that structural adaptation can be done in units of milliseconds since the worst-case decision-making process does not exceed the reconﬁguration time of a partial bit-stream.},
