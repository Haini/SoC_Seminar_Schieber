\begin{abstract}
    A system can be described as fault-tolerant if it can continue at the same level of performance event though one or more components have failed. 
    This property is inherently important for systems that operate without any chance of maintenance.
    \glspl{FPGA} provide the opportunity of \gls{DPR}, which provides them with the ability to efficiently react to faults that are introduced through environmental (e.g. radiation, heat) or internal (e.g. a malicious \gls{IP}) changes.
    Through the structural adaptions that are possible with \gls{DPR}, faulty chip areas can be avoided and a graceful degradation of performance with high granularity in reply to power constraints is possible.
    It also enables efficiency through selective instantiation of needed functionality.
    
    This work focuses on fault mitigation aspects of such systems. 
    It includes a review of the types of faults that occur, methods for their detection and how certain faults can be mitigated. 
    We show that there is a wide variety of research on this topic that is especially mature in the aeronautics and space sector.
    Particularly the mitigation of faults within \glspl{FPGA} is widely researched.
    We also find that \gls{DPR} is rarely used to replace the functionality of external modules although this approach seems to provide a good base for economical redundancy solutions.
    \gls{DPR} in general enables a fault mitigation solution on the architectural level that enables the usage of commercial off-the-shelf hardware for uses under extreme conditions.

%\subsection{Network on Chip - make fault-tolerant per design}
%\cite{yesil_fpga_2016} adds additional network resources to a non-fault-tolerant design to mitigate interconnect faults.

%\cite{glein_self-adaptive_2014} tackles the problem of radiation by the creation of redundant modules - based on currently measured \glspl{SEU} rates in on-chip memories.
%\subsection{Dynamic Partial Self-Reconfiguration}
%\cite{alkady_dynamic_2015} goes on to propose system recovery by re-instantiating defective modules into the Partially Reconfigurable block.
