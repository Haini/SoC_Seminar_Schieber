\title{Dynamic Partial Self-Reconfiguration of Self-Aware Systems}
\author{Constantin Schieber, 01228774}
\begin{document}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
    This work focuses on fault aspects of Self-Aware Systems.
    This includes a review of the types of faults that are occurring, methods for their detection and how one mitigate certain faults. 
    One could argue that \glspl{NoC} are Self-Aware too, as the nodes / controllers monitor the behaviour of the throughput and can react accordingly to arising situations.

%\section{Mitigation of Faults}
%\subsection{Network on Chip - make fault-tolerant per design}
%\cite{yesil_fpga_2016} adds additional network resources to a non-fault-tolerant design to mitigate interconnect faults.
%
%\cite{lu_fault-tolerant_2015} provides a case study on implementing a fault-tolerant routing algorithm and its monitoring mechanism.
%\subsection{Redundancy by need based replication}
%\cite{glein_self-adaptive_2014} tackles the problem of radiation by the creation of redundant modules - based on currently measured \glspl{SEU} rates in on-chip memories.
%\subsection{Dynamic Partial Self-Reconfiguration}
%\cite{alkady_dynamic_2015} goes on to propose system recovery by re-instantiating defective modules into the Partially Reconfigurable block.
%
%\cite{shanker_enhancing_nodate} proposes a similar solution in the context of \glspl{ECU}.
%
%\cite{sharma_run-time_2018} shows an approach on how to decide which configuration is currently desired in a multi-modal / multi-task \gls{SoPC}.
